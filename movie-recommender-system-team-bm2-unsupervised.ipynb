In particular, movie content recommendations rely on intelligent algorithms to help viewers discover great titles from a vast array of options. Companies like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Showmax, and Disney have successfully employed recommendation algorithms to suggest personalized content to their users. The challenge at hand is to construct a recommendation algorithm based on content or collaborative filtering that accurately predicts how a user will rate a movie they have not yet viewed, leveraging their historical preferences.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"cont\"></a>\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n<a href=#one>1.

Introduction\nIn the era of digital media consumption, recommender systems have become pivotal for guiding users towards relevant and engaging content. Platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Showmax, and Disney have mastered the art of providing personalized recommendations, enhancing user satisfaction and driving revenue. Behind these recommendations lies a sophisticated algorithm that analyzes user preferences and historical data to predict their potential interest in unexplored movies.\n\nIn this Jupyter notebook, we will tackle the challenge presented by EA, aiming to build a functional recommender system capable of accurately predicting user ratings for unseen movies. By leveraging content-based or collaborative filtering techniques, we will develop an algorithm that harnesses the power of historical user data to generate meaningful recommendations.\n\nThe value of constructing an effective recommender system is immense, both economically and socially. A successful solution to this challenge can open doors to increased user engagement, platform affinity, and revenue generation. The evaluation metric for this competition is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), a widely used measure in regression analysis and forecasting. By minimizing the RMSE, we can enhance the accuracy and reliability of our recommendation algorithm, improving user satisfaction and driving platform success.\n\nTo participate in this competition, submission files should adhere to a specific format. Each submission should include two columns: \"Id\" and \"rating.\" The \"Id\" column should consist of a concatenation of the userID and movieID, separated by an underscore (_). The \"rating\" column should contain the predicted rating for the corresponding user-movie pair.\n\nLet's dive into the challenge and develop an innovative recommendation algorithm that brings users closer to the movies they love.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data Overview\n\nThe dataset provided for this challenge consists of several million 5-star ratings obtained from users of the online MovieLens movie recommendation service. The MovieLens dataset has been widely used by both industry and academic researchers to enhance the performance of recommender systems. In this challenge, we will be working with a special version of the MovieLens dataset that has been enriched with additional data and resampled to ensure fair evaluation.\n\nSource:\nThe MovieLens dataset is maintained by the GroupLens research group at the University of Minnesota's Department of Computer Science and Engineering. Additional movie content data has been legally scraped from IMDB to enrich the dataset.\n\nSupplied Files:\n\n1. ##### genome_scores.csv: \nThis file contains scores that map the strength between movies and tag-related properties. It provides valuable insights into the characteristics and attributes associated with movies.\n\n2. ##### genome_tags.csv: \nUser-assigned tags corresponding to the genome-related scores are provided in this file.\n\n3. ##### imdb_data.csv: \nThis file includes additional movie metadata that was scraped from IMDB using the links.csv file.\n\n4. ##### links.csv: \nIt provides a mapping between the MovieLens ID and associated IMDB and TMDB IDs, allowing cross-referencing of movie data from different sources.\n\n5. ##### sample_submission.csv: \nThis file serves as a sample submission format for the hackathon.\n\n6. ##### tags.csv: \nUser-assigned tags for the movies within the dataset are provided in this file.\n\n7. ##### test.csv: \nThis file contains the test split of the dataset, which includes user and movie IDs but no rating data.\n\n8. ##### train.csv: \nThe training split of the dataset is provided in this file. It contains user and movie IDs with associated rating data.\n\n###### Additional Information:\nThe following information is derived directly from the MovieLens dataset description files:\n\nRatings Data File Structure (train.csv):\nThe train.csv file contains all the ratings in the dataset. Each line represents one rating of one movie by one user and follows the format: userId, movieId, rating, timestamp. The lines in the file are ordered first by userId and then, within each user, by movieId. Ratings are provided on a 5-star scale with half-star increments.\n\n###### Tags Data File Structure (tags.csv):\nThe tags.csv file contains all the user-assigned tags for movies in the dataset. Each line represents one tag applied to one movie by one user and follows the format: userId, movieId, tag, timestamp. The lines in the file are ordered first by userId and then, within each user, by movieId. Tags are user-generated metadata about movies, typically represented by a single word or short phrase.\n\n###### Movies Data File Structure (movies.csv):\nThe movies.csv file contains information about each movie in the dataset. Each line represents one movie and follows the format: movieId, title, genres. Movie titles are manually entered or imported from https://www.themoviedb.org/ and include the year of release in parentheses. The genres are listed as pipe-separated values.\n\n###### Links Data File Structure (links.csv):\nThe links.csv file provides identifiers that can be used to link to other sources of movie data. Each line represents one movie and follows the format: movieId, imdbId, tmdbId. The movieId corresponds to the identifier used by https://movielens.org. imdbId corresponds to the identifier used by http://www.imdb.com, and tmdbId corresponds to the identifier used by https://www.themoviedb.org.\n\n###### Tag Genome (genome-scores.csv and genome-tags.csv):\nThe tag genome represents how strongly movies exhibit specific properties or characteristics encoded by tags, such as being atmospheric, thought-provoking, or realistic. The genome-scores.csv file contains movie-tag relevance data in the format: movieId, tagId, relevance. The genome-tags","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Importing Packages","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport cufflinks as
