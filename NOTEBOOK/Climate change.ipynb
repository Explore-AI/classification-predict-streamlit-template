Decision trees learn from data to approximate a sine curve with a set of if-then-else decision rules. The deeper the tree, the more complex the decision rules and the fitter the model.\n\nDecision tree builds classification or regression models in the form of a tree structure. It breaks down data by partitioning it into subsets after each decision while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed. The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes. A decision node has two or more branches. Leaf node represents a classification or decision. The topmost decision node in a tree which corresponds to the best predictor called root node. Decision trees can handle both categorical and numerical data.\n\nVisual representation of a `Decision Tree`\n![1*WerHJ14JQAd3j8ASaVjAhw.jpeg](https://miro.medium.com/max/963/1*WerHJ14JQAd3j8ASaVjAhw.jpeg)\n\n\nDecision trees are prone to overfitting. Overfitting happens when the learning algorithm continues to develop hypotheses that reduce training set error at the cost of an increased test set error; One method to tackle overfitting in decision trees is by **prunning**.\nThere are several approaches used to avoid overfitting in building decision trees namely, \t\t\n- Pre-pruning that stops growing the tree earlier, before it perfectly classifies the training set.\n- Post-pruning that allows the tree to perfectly classify the training set, and then post prune the tree. \nPractically, the second approach of post-pruning overfit trees is more successful because it is not easy to precisely estimate when to stop growing the tree.\n\nDecision Trees are building blocks for the next machine learning method we will look into, which is the **Random Forest Classifier**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='random'></a>\n### Random Forest Classifier\n`Random forest` is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used both for classification and regression. A forest is comprised of a number of individual trees. It is said that the more trees it has, the more robust a forest is, unlike decision trees `Random Forest`  prevents overfitting by creating trees on random subsets  \n\nThe Random forest algorithm works in four steps\n\n 1. Selects a number of random samples from a given dataset\n 2. Construct a decision tree for each sample and get a prediction result from each decision tree\n 3. Perform a vote for each predicted result.\n 4. Select the prediction result with the most votes as the final prediction.\n\na visual representation of a Random Forest classifier is seen in the diagram below\n![voting_dnjweq.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/dyd911kmh/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1526467744/voting_dnjweq.jpg)\n\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Support Vector Classification(LinearSVC)\nSVM or Support Vector Machine is a linear model for classification and regression problems.

Our goal is to maximize the margin.\n\nIn a case for more than two classes the goal is to find the the best hyperplane that seperates the classes.\nThe hyperplane for which the margin is maximum is the optimal hyperplane.\n\nBelow is a visual representation of how `SVMs` work\n\n<p float=\"left\">\n  <img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/880/1*VDATmWG1E1ZNg7hdasOh5g.png\" width=\"400\" />\n  <img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/880/1*AMR3v-jCvUMXPUtQskzxmQ.png\" width=\"400\" />\n  <img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/880/1*irg_jfdAar9gfe0j-Q04vQ.png\" width=\"400\" />\n</p>\n\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Light Gradient Boosting Machine(LightGBM)\nLightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that also uses a tree based learning algorithm.
