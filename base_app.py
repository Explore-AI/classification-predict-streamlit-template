    Description: This file is used to launch a minimal streamlit web
	application. You are expected to extend the functionality of this script
	as part of your predict project.

         that are environmentally friendly and sustainable, in line with their values and ideals. They would like to determine how people perceive
         climate change and whether or not they believe it is a real threat. This would add to their market research efforts in gauging how their
         product/service may be received.With this context, EDSA is challenging you during the Classification Sprint with the task of creating a
         Machine Learning model that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data.Providing
         an accurate and robust solution to this task gives companies access to a broad base of consumer sentiment, spanning multiple demographic and geographic
          categories - thus increasing their insights and informing future marketing strategies. """)
